Chess Game in C++ with Advanced OOP Concepts and Qt Graphics Library

This project is a chess game developed in C++ with advanced object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts and the Qt graphics library. The game features a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows players to interact with the game board and pieces.

The design of the game is based on the principles of object-oriented programming, with classes for the game board, pieces, players, and more. These classes are designed to be modular and easily extendable, allowing for future enhancements to the game.

The game includes various advanced OOP concepts, such as inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction, to create a clean and efficient codebase. The implementation of these concepts allows for the creation of complex game features with minimal code complexity.

The Qt graphics library is used to provide a visually appealing and user-friendly GUI. The library allows for easy creation of windows, buttons, and other graphical elements. The game's GUI is designed to be intuitive and easy to use, with clear instructions and visual cues for players.

In addition to the standard chess game rules, this project includes various additional features such as undo/redo moves, saving/loading games, and AI-based computer opponent. These features are implemented using the advanced OOP concepts and Qt library.

The project is well-documented and includes detailed comments throughout the codebase, making it easy to understand and extend. This project is ideal for anyone interested in learning about advanced OOP concepts, graphics programming with Qt, or developing a chess game in C++.
